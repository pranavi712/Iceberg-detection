# Iceberg-detection
Iceberg Detection using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite radar images as either icebergs or ships. The images are synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, and the goal is to build an accurate deep learning model that can distinguish between these two categories based on pixel patterns.

Key Features

-> Preprocessing of dual-band SAR image data (band_1, band_2)

-> Image transformation and normalization for model training

->Implementation of a custom CNN using TensorFlow/Keras

->Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

->Visualization of training progress and predictions

Tech Stack:

Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
